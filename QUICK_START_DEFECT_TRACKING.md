---

## ⚡ 30-Minute Quick Setup

### Step 1: Jira Setup (10 minutes)

1. **Create Account**: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free
2. **Create Project**: 
   - Template: Scrum
   - Name: "Food Ordering API Testing"
   - Key: FOAT
3. **Done!** Note your URL: https://[your-name].atlassian.net

### Step 2: Create Bug #1 (10 minutes)

**Click "Create" in Jira** and paste this:

```
Summary: Complete Server Configuration Exposure via /api/admin/config

Priority: Highest
Labels: security, configuration, critical

Description:
CRITICAL Security Vulnerability

The /api/admin/config endpoint exposes database credentials, JWT secrets, 
and API keys without authentication.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd "H:\4th Semester\QA Project\2\backend"
2. npm run vulnerable
3. curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config
4. Observe complete configuration exposure

Expected Results:
- Should require authentication
- Should return 401/403 for unauthorized access

Actual Results:
- Returns database credentials: mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017
- Returns JWT secret: super-secret-key-12345
- Returns API keys: Stripe, AWS, SendGrid

Security Impact:
- Complete system compromise possible
- All credentials exposed
- No authentication required

OWASP: A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
Severity: CRITICAL
```

**Click Create**. Bug ID: ________

### Step 3: Create Bug #2 (10 minutes)

**Click "Create" again** and paste:

```
Summary: Missing Security Headers Enable Clickjacking Attacks

Priority: High
Labels: security-headers, clickjacking

Description:
MAJOR Security Vulnerability

Server lacks critical security headers making it vulnerable to 
clickjacking and XSS attacks.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. npm run vulnerable
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Visit http://localhost:5000
5. Check Response Headers

Expected Results:
Should have:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Actual Results:
- All security headers missing
- Admin panel can be embedded in iframe
- XSS attacks possible

Security Impact:
- Clickjacking attacks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- MIME type attacks

OWASP: A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
Severity: MAJOR
```

## 📝 1-Hour Root Cause Analysis

Open Bug #1 in Jira. Add this as a **Comment** or **Description update**:

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

### Why It Happened

1. **Missing Authentication**
   - No authentication middleware on /api/admin/config endpoint
   - Any user can access without credentials

2. **No Authorization Checks**
   - No role verification
   - Admin endpoints not protected

3. **Development Code in Production**
   - Debug endpoint left active
   - No environment-based filtering

4. **Lack of Security Review**
   - No security checklist used
   - Endpoints not reviewed for authentication

### How It Was Fixed

Added authentication middleware:
```javascript
// Secure version (app-secure.js)
app.get('/api/admin/config', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Admin access required' });
    }
    res.json({
        settings: { maxUploadSize: '10MB' }
        // No sensitive data
    });
});
```

Key changes:
1. ✅ Authentication required (JWT token)
2. ✅ Authorization check (admin role)
3. ✅ Limited response (safe data only)
4. ✅ No credentials exposed

### How to Prevent Future Bugs

**Development Process:**
1. Security checklist for all new endpoints
2. Mandatory code reviews with security focus
3. OWASP Top 10 training for developers

**Technical Controls:**
1. Authentication middleware on all sensitive endpoints
2. Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Environment-based configuration

**Testing:**
1. Automated security scanning (OWASP ZAP)
2. Static code analysis (SonarQube)
3. Security unit tests

**Monitoring:**
1. Log all admin endpoint access
2. Alert on authentication failures
3. Regular security audits

### Verification

Before fix:
- curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config
- Result: Exposed credentials ❌

After fix:
- Same command
- Result: 401 Unauthorized ✅
```

## 🎤 15-Minute Viva Demonstration

### Opening (1 min)
```
"I've set up professional defect tracking in Jira and identified 
2 security vulnerabilities in the Food Ordering API."
```

### Show Jira (2 min)
- Open Jira
- Show 2 bugs: FOAT-1 (Critical), FOAT-2 (Major)
- "Both have detailed reproduction steps and security impact analysis"

### Demonstrate Bug #1 (5 min)
```powershell
cd "H:\4th Semester\QA Project\2\backend"
npm run vulnerable
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config
```

"As you can see, database credentials and API keys are exposed without authentication. This is critical because anyone can access this."

### Explain RCA (5 min)
"I performed root cause analysis on the configuration exposure bug:

**Why it happened:**
- Missing authentication middleware
- No authorization checks  
- Development code in production

**How I fixed it:**
- Added JWT authentication
- Added admin role check
- Limited response to safe data only

**Prevention:**
- Security checklist for new endpoints
- Automated security scanning
- Developer security training
- Regular security audits"

### Closing (1 min)
"Both bugs documented in Jira with severity, reproduction steps, and impact analysis. Root cause analysis complete with prevention strategies."

### Demo Complete (1 min)
"Ready for questions!"

## ❓ Answer These 3 Questions

**Q1: "How did you find these bugs?"**
```
"Manual security testing - I accessed admin endpoints without 
authentication and found the config exposure. I used Chrome DevTools 
to check security headers and found them missing. Also used OWASP ZAP 
for automated scanning."
```

**Q2: "Why is Bug #1 critical?"**
```
"No authentication required, exposes all system credentials, leads to 
complete system compromise. High exploitability and high business impact."
```

**Q3: "How do you prevent this?"**
```
"Multiple layers: 
1. Process - security checklist and code reviews
2. Technical - authentication middleware and RBAC
3. Testing - automated security scanning in CI/CD
4. Monitoring - audit logs and alerts
5. Training - OWASP Top 10 for developers"
```
