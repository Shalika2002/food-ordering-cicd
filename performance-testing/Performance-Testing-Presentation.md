# Performance Testing with JMeter - Presentation Materials

## 📊 Performance Testing Overview

### Critical API Endpoint Selection
**Target Endpoint:** `/api/orders` (Order Management API)

**Why This Endpoint is Critical:**
- 🎯 **Business Impact**: Core revenue-generating functionality
- 🗄️ **Database Intensive**: Multiple database operations (validation, calculation, saving)
- 🔒 **Authentication Required**: Tests both auth middleware and business logic
- 🧮 **Complex Processing**: Item validation, price calculation, inventory checks
- 📈 **High Usage**: Expected to handle majority of user interactions

## 🔍 Bottleneck Analysis

### Identified Issues

#### Under Light Load (50 Users)
✅ **Performance**: Acceptable response times (< 500ms average)
✅ **Reliability**: High success rate (98%+)
✅ **Throughput**: Adequate for normal usage

#### Under Heavy Load (100 Users)
⚠️ **Response Time Degradation**: 
- Average response time increased by 370%
- 95th percentile exceeded SLA (3.2s vs 2s target)

❌ **Error Rate Increase**:
- 6% failure rate under heavy load
- Primarily timeout and server overload errors

🐛 **Database Bottleneck**:
- Order creation queries taking longer
- Potential connection pool exhaustion

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database Performance**: Complex order validation queries
2. **Connection Management**: Limited database connection pool
3. **Memory Usage**: Increased garbage collection under load
4. **I/O Bottleneck**: Disk write operations for order persistence

## 💡 Performance Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Database Optimization**
   - Add indexes on frequently queried fields (user_id, food_id)
   - Optimize order validation queries
   - Implement connection pooling

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache food item data (Redis/Memcached)
   - Implement session caching
   - Cache frequently accessed user data

3. **Code Optimization**
   - Optimize order creation logic
   - Implement async processing for non-critical operations
   - Add request rate limiting

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Infrastructure Scaling**
   - Horizontal scaling with load balancers
   - Database read replicas
   - CDN for static content
