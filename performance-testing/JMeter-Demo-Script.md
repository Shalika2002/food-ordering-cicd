## üöÄ Live Demonstration Script

### Phase 1: Introduction & Setup (3 minutes)

**Presenter Actions:**
1. **Open JMeter GUI**
   ```bash
   # In terminal
   cd "H:\4th Semester\QA Project\2\performance-testing"
   jmeter
   ```

2. **Load Test Plan**
   - File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select `Critical-Order-API-Load-Test.jmx`
   - Expand test plan tree structure

**What to Say:**
> "Let me show you our JMeter load testing setup for the critical Order API. I'll open JMeter GUI and load our test plan that focuses on the most business-critical endpoint - order creation."

**Point Out:**
- Test plan structure in the left panel
- Authentication setup in the setUp Thread Group
- Two load scenarios: Light (50 users) and Heavy (100 users)
- Various listeners for comprehensive monitoring

### Phase 2: Test Plan Walkthrough (4 minutes)

**Navigate Through Test Plan Components:**

1. **Show Test Plan Variables**
   - Click on "Critical Order API Load Test"
   - Highlight BASE_URL, API_PATH, TEST_USERNAME, TEST_PASSWORD
   
   **Say:** *"We've configured variables for easy environment switching"*

2. **Authentication Setup**
   - Click on "setUp Thread Group - Authentication"
   - Show "Login - Get Auth Token" request
   - Click on "Extract Auth Token" post-processor
   
   **Say:** *"This setup thread runs once to authenticate and extract the JWT token for all subsequent requests"*

3. **Main Load Test Scenario**
   - Click on "Order API Load Test - Light Load (50 Users)"
   - Show thread group settings: 50 users, 60 second ramp-up
   - Expand to show the 3 HTTP requests:
     - Get Available Food Items
     - **Create Order - CRITICAL ENDPOINT** (highlight this)
     - Get My Orders

4. **Critical Endpoint Details**
   - Click on "Create Order - CRITICAL ENDPOINT"
   - Show the JSON payload with dynamic data
   - Point out the Authorization header using ${auth_token}
   - Show response assertions and time limits

**What to Say:**
> "The test simulates realistic user behavior: first getting available food items, then creating an order with random quantities, and finally checking their order history. The critical order creation endpoint includes complex business logic with database operations."

### Phase 3: Listeners and Monitoring Setup (2 minutes)

**Show Monitoring Configuration:**
1. **Summary Report** - Overall statistics
2. **Response Times Over Time** - Performance trends
3. **Throughput Over Time** - Request rate monitoring
4. **Errors Over Time** - Error pattern tracking

**What to Say:**
> "We've configured multiple listeners to capture comprehensive performance data. These will show us real-time graphs and detailed metrics during the test execution."

### Phase 4: Live Test Execution (6 minutes)

**Option A: Quick GUI Test (Recommended for demo)**

1. **Prepare for Quick Test**
   - Right-click on "Heavy Load" thread group ‚Üí Disable
   - Modify Light Load settings for demo:
     - Reduce to 10 users
     - Set ramp-up to 20 seconds
     - Set loops to 2

   **Say:** *"For this demo, I'll run a scaled-down version so we can see results quickly"*

2. **Start the Test**
   - Click the green "Start" button (play icon)
   - Immediately switch to listeners to show real-time data

3. **Show Real-Time Results**
   - **Summary Report**: Point out samples, average response time, throughput
   - **Response Times Over Time**: Show the graph building in real-time
   - **View Results Tree**: Show individual request/response details

   **Commentary During Test:**
   > "Watch how the response times vary as load increases... You can see the throughput climbing... Notice any errors appearing..."

4. **Test Completion**
   - Wait for test to complete (~2-3 minutes)
   - Show final summary statistics
   - Point out key metrics

**Option B: PowerShell Automated Test (If time permits)**

1. **Open PowerShell**
   ```powershell
   cd "H:\4th Semester\QA Project\2\performance-testing"
   .\run-critical-load-test.ps1 -TestType light -Duration 120
   ```

2. **Show Script Output**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Prerequisites checking
   - Server connectivity test
   - Results analysis

**What to Say:**
> "Our PowerShell script automates the entire testing process and provides comprehensive analysis of bottlenecks and performance issues."

### Phase 5: Results Analysis (3 minutes)

**Show Key Metrics:**
1. **Response Time Analysis**
   - Average response time for order creation
   - 95th percentile response times
   - Performance degradation under load

2. **Throughput Metrics**
   - Requests per second
   - Success rate percentage
   - Error patterns

3. **Bottleneck Identification**
   - Database query performance
   - Connection pool issues
   - Memory usage patterns

**Sample Commentary:**
> "From our test results, we can see that under 50 concurrent users, the system performs well with average response times under 500ms. However, at 100 users, we see significant degradation with response times exceeding 2 seconds, indicating database bottlenecks."

### Phase 6: Generated Reports (2 minutes)

**Show HTML Report (if available):**
1. Navigate to generated HTML report
2. Show dashboard overview
3. Highlight response time graphs
4. Show error analysis

**Say:** *"JMeter automatically generates comprehensive HTML reports with detailed graphs and analysis that can be shared with stakeholders."*
