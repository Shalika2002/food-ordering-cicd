```
Product: Food Ordering API
Component: Backend Security  
Version: v1.0.0
Severity: Critical
Priority: P1
Hardware: All
OS: All
Assignee: backend-dev-team@company.com
QA Contact: security-team@company.com

Summary: Complete Server Configuration Exposure

Description:
SECURITY VULNERABILITY - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

The /api/admin/config endpoint exposes complete system configuration 
including sensitive credentials without any authentication checks.

AFFECTED ENDPOINT: GET /api/admin/config
VULNERABILITY TYPE: Information Disclosure / Broken Access Control
OWASP CATEGORY: A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Start vulnerable server: npm run vulnerable  
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config
3. Observe complete configuration exposure

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Should require authentication
- Should return 401/403 for unauthorized access  
- Should not expose sensitive configuration

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- Returns complete system configuration
- Exposes database credentials: mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017
- Exposes JWT secret: super-secret-key-12345
- Exposes API keys: Stripe, AWS, SendGrid

SECURITY IMPACT:
- Complete system compromise possible
- Database access with admin credentials
- API abuse with exposed keys
- Regulatory compliance violations

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Data breach risk
- Financial losses from API abuse
- Reputation damage
- Legal liability

SUGGESTED FIX:
1. Add authentication middleware to endpoint
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Return limited, safe configuration only
4. Add security headers and rate limiting

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
This vulnerability allows attackers to gain complete system access
without authentication. Immediate patching required.

Custom Fields:
Security Level: Critical
OWASP Category: A01:2021 - Broken Access Control  
CVE Reference: Pending assignment
Exploit PoC: http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config
```

#### Template 2: Functional Bug
```
Product: Food Ordering API
Component: Authentication
Version: v1.0.0  
Severity: Major
Priority: P2
Hardware: All
OS: All

Summary: Password Exposed in Authentication Response

Description:
The login API endpoint returns user passwords in plain text within 
the authentication response, violating security best practices.

ENDPOINT: POST /api/auth/login
BUG TYPE: Information Disclosure
SECURITY RISK: High

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Start server: npm run vulnerable
2. POST to /api/auth/login with: {"username":"admin","password":"admin123"} 
3. Check response payload
4. Observe password in response

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Password should not be included in authentication response

ACTUAL RESULTS:  
Response includes: "password": "admin123"
Also exposes previousPasswords array and security questions

IMPACT:
- Password harvesting possible
- Credential exposure in logs/traffic
- Privacy violations

SUGGESTED FIX:
Remove password field from user object before sending response

Custom Fields:
Security Level: High
OWASP Category: A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures
```
