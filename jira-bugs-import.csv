"Complete Server Configuration Exposure via /api/admin/config",Bug,Highest,"security, configuration, critical","## 🚨 CRITICAL Security Vulnerability

The `/api/admin/config` endpoint in `app-vulnerable.js` exposes complete system configuration including database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys without any authentication checks.

### 🎯 Vulnerability Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/config`
- **Authentication Required**: ❌ None (VULNERABILITY)
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)

### 🔍 Information Exposed
- Database credentials: `mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017`
- JWT secret: `super-secret-key-12345`
- API keys: Stripe, AWS, SendGrid

### 🧪 Steps to Reproduce
1. Start vulnerable server: `npm run vulnerable`
2. Access endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/config`
3. Observe complete configuration exposure

### ✅ Expected Results
Should require authentication and not expose sensitive data

### ❌ Actual Results
Returns complete system configuration including sensitive credentials

### 💥 Security Impact
- Complete system compromise possible
- Compliance violations (GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS)

### 🛠️ Fix Location

"Missing Security Headers Enable Clickjacking Attacks",Bug,High,"security-headers, clickjacking, xss","## ⚠️ MAJOR Security Vulnerability

The server lacks critical security headers making it vulnerable to clickjacking, XSS, and MIME type attacks.

### 🎯 Missing Security Headers
- ❌ X-Frame-Options: DENY (Allows clickjacking)
- ❌ Content-Security-Policy (Enables XSS attacks)
- ❌ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (MIME type attacks)
- ❌ Strict-Transport-Security (No HSTS protection)

### 🧪 Steps to Reproduce
1. Start vulnerable server: `npm run vulnerable`
2. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
4. Check response headers - observe missing security headers
5. Test clickjacking: Page can be embedded in iframe

### ✅ Expected Results
All security headers should be present

### ❌ Actual Results
Response headers missing critical security protections

### 💥 Security Impact
- Clickjacking attacks on admin panel
- XSS vulnerabilities via missing CSP
- MIME type attacks

### 🛠️ Recommended Fix
Add security headers middleware with helmet.js",High,CVE-2024-0002,A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration,Shalika Hathursinghe
"User Password Exposed in Authentication Response",Bug,High,"authentication, data-exposure, privacy","## ⚠️ MAJOR Privacy & Security Violation

The login endpoint returns user passwords in plain text within the authentication response, violating security best practices and privacy regulations.

### 🎯 Vulnerability Details
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Issue**: Password included in response payload
- **Privacy Impact**: GDPR violation

### 🧪 Steps to Reproduce
1. Start vulnerable server: `npm run vulnerable`
2. Send login request: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""username"":""admin"",""password"":""admin123""}'`
3. Examine response - observe password exposure

### ✅ Expected Results
Authentication response should exclude password

### ❌ Actual Results
Response includes password, previous passwords, and security questions

### 💥 Security Impact
- Password harvesting from responses
- Credential exposure in application logs
- Privacy violations (GDPR compliance issues)

### 🛠️ Recommended Fix
Remove sensitive data from user object before sending response",High,CVE-2024-0003,A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures,Shalika Hathursinghe
"Stack Traces and System Information Exposed in Error Messages",Bug,Medium,"information-disclosure, debugging","## 📋 Information Disclosure Issue

Error handling middleware exposes detailed system information including stack traces, file paths, and environment details in error responses.

### 🎯 Information Exposed
- Complete stack traces with file paths
- Node.js version information  
- Platform and architecture details
- Request headers and body data

### 🧪 Steps to Reproduce
1. Start vulnerable server: `npm run vulnerable`
2. Trigger an error: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/invalid-endpoint`
3. Examine error response for information disclosure

### ✅ Expected Results
Generic error message without system details

### ❌ Actual Results
Detailed error information including stack traces and system info

### 💥 Security Impact
- System fingerprinting from version info
- Path disclosure from stack traces
- Technology stack information exposure

### 🛠️ Recommended Fix
Implement secure error handling without information disclosure",Medium,CVE-2024-0004,A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration,Shalika Hathursinghe
