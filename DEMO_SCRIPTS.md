# Test Automation & CI/CD Demonstration Scripts
## Food Ordering System - Viva Presentation

### Pre-Demonstration Setup

#### 1. Environment Preparation
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd food-ordering-system

# 2. Install dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install

# 3. Start MongoDB (if not running)
# Windows: 
net start MongoDB
# Linux/Mac:
sudo systemctl start mongod

# 4. Setup environment variables (create .env in backend)
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/food-ordering" > backend/.env
echo "JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key" >> backend/.env
```

#### 2. Service Startup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend Server
cd backend
npm run seed    # Seed test data
npm start       # Start on port 5000

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend Server  
cd frontend

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

```bash
# Issue: MongoDB connection failed
# Solution:
echo "Checking MongoDB status..."
mongosh --eval "db.runCommand('ping')" || echo "Start MongoDB service"

# Issue: Port already in use
# Solution:
echo "Checking port usage..."
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Issue: ChromeDriver not found
# Solution:
npm update selenium-webdriver
# Or manually install chromedriver

# Issue: Tests timeout
# Solution:
echo "Increase timeout in jest.config.js"
echo "Check if all services are running"

# Issue: Coverage threshold not met
# Solution:
echo "Add more unit tests"
echo "Remove excluded files from coverage"
```

### Performance Tips

```bash
echo "=== PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ==="
echo ""
echo "üöÄ Speed Improvements:"
echo "- Run unit tests first (fastest feedback)"
echo "- Use --bail flag to stop on first failure"
echo "- Run UI tests in headless mode for CI"
echo "- Parallel test execution where possible"
echo "- Cache dependencies in CI/CD"
```
