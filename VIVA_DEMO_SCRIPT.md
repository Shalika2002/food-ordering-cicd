#### Actions:
1. **Start the applications** (in separate terminals):
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run UI tests**:
   ```powershell
   # Terminal 3 - Tests

## üéØ Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Why did you choose Selenium over other UI testing tools?"**
**A:** "Selenium provides excellent cross-browser compatibility, integrates well with our CI/CD pipeline, and offers mature tooling. It's industry standard and supports our Page Object Model architecture."

**Q: "How do you handle test data management?"**
**A:** "We use MongoDB Memory Server for unit/API tests providing isolation, and a dedicated test database with seeded data for UI tests. Each test suite cleans up after execution."

**Q: "What happens if tests fail in the CI/CD pipeline?"**
**A:** "Failed tests prevent deployment progression. The pipeline generates detailed reports, captures screenshots for UI failures, and notifies the team. We use continue-on-error strategically for non-blocking issues."

**Q: "How maintainable are your tests?"**
**A:** "Very maintainable - we use Page Object Model for UI tests, centralized configuration, proper mocking for unit tests, and clear naming conventions. Tests are organized by feature and type."

**Q: "Can you explain your test pyramid strategy?"**
**A:** "We follow the test pyramid: many fast unit tests at the base, fewer integration/API tests in the middle, and selective but comprehensive UI tests at the top. This provides good coverage while maintaining speed."
